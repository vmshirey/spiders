# spiders
 This repository contains necessary code for reproducing analyses conducted for "Current GBIF occurrence data demonstrates both promise and limitations for potential red listing of spiders." Using the EOO (extent of occurrence) function in the R-package "red" it calcuates the EOO from a variety of source datasets including literature, GBIF, and a combined literature and GBIF dataset.
